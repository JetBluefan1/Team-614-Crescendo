## Autonomous Documentation
Each auto is sorted by the side of the subwoofer that our robot will start on.

- FS = Front Side
- SS = Source Side
- AS = Amp Side

Remember to check that your driver station is set to the correct alliance when enabling auto, as using the wrong alliance will flip the auto. Every auto also fires the preloaded shot immediately.

### FS 6P

A six piece auto that grabs and scores the 3 gamepieces on our side, then grabs one from the middle, scores, and heads for a 6th.

### SS 3P

A three piece auto that goes to less contested pieces closer to the source and gets 2 pieces. Best served with teammate FS auto.

### AS 3P

A three piece auto that goes to the upper center to grab the pieces before another team can. Great to pair with a 4P auto team on FS.
